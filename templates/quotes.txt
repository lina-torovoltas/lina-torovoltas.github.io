# Listen here, you idiots. 
# Do you think you are hard to find? 
# The right people are already doing it. 
# There are links in the FBI. 
# The first data on particularly active already received. 
# It is better to stop this "campaign", otherwise we will have to take action. 
# You have touched the wrong people, and will have to answer. 
# You have no idea how far it can go. 
# If someone wants to learn the hard way, then keep doing what you are doing. 
# You have been warned.

# Wrote "hello world" and a calculator — good job.
# Stop right there.
# Don’t go digging into these compilers and GitHubs.
# This is not the corridors of NASA’s clean rooms, not the data centers of Google, not the cozy offices of Facebook.
# IT is a field you better stay away from.
# Seriously, any of you will regret it.
# Better close Habrahabr and forget what’s written here.
# It’s all a lie, meant to attract as many new monkeys to the workplaces and create wage dumping.
# I fully understand that this message will spark additional interest from bigwigs at Cisco, SAP, and IBM, but I want to immediately warn the curious — stop.
# IT salaries are very depressing.
# Others just don’t get them.

# The father of a friend works in the FBI.
# Today, he was urgently called to a meeting.
# He returned late and didn’t explain anything.
# He only said to pack things and go to the store for food for two weeks.
# Now we’re heading somewhere far out of the city.
# I don’t know what’s going on, but it feels like it’s started...

# Predictions suggest that Windows 7 could surpass XP much sooner than Vista.
# This might happen even on processors with 16 or 24 cores.
# For now, switching from Vista to Windows 7 won’t cost you anything.
# It might even improve performance.
# This is due to the more optimized kernel settings in the new operating system.

# IT'S TIME TO REINSTALL WINDOWS.

# Hello, you're sweet and look very stunning!
# This doesn’t happen often — I immediately wanted to write to you, I liked you a lot.
# How about meeting up in the evening and having a nice time?
# We can get to know each other, talk, and see if we like each other.
# The only thing is, I'm not looking for anything serious right now, but I do want regular meetings.

# I was heading home and noticed a girl standing there with a book — "The Sun Kissed the Earth. Poems of the Silver Age."
# Her face was delicate, almost ethereal — truly spiritual.
# I thought to myself, "I should introduce myself, she’s my type."
# I gathered my courage to approach her as she was about to leave.
# But then she closed the book — and bent the corner of the page instead of using a bookmark.

# It felt like a bucket of cold water poured over me.
# I felt so disgusted and upset.
# What a disappointment.

# Things were so different back then.
# My grandfather had a Wi-Fi router, made back in Stalin’s time.
# It weighed 50 kg, and the Wi-Fi signal it provided was thick, dense, with the smell of coal smoke!
# And the internet in the USSR was completely different: you’d log on, and everyone would greet you.
# Your private messages would be filled with freshly sent health wishes from subscribers by the morning, and everyone donated at least 5 rubles (in those days!!!) without any questions.
# People were cultured because IPs were openly visible, and accounts were kept without passwords.
# Sometimes, for 50 kopecks, you could buy 50 gigabytes — real gigabytes, GOST standard.
# It was awesome!

# On VKontakte, everyone was educated, they wrote without mistakes, and argued about synchrophasotron theory.
# Computers in stores were only 3 rubles, and the shelves were full.

# If you got unlimited access, they’d pay you extra!
# Dial-up speeds were like what you’d get on twisted pair, twisted pair was like fiber optics, and fiber was directly soldered to the PCIE slots in data centers.

# Kids were born with beards and in sweaters with reindeer, and as soon as they left the maternity ward, they’d beg to become admins for major ISPs.

# In the workshop, the guys would install FreeBSD on German machines, and they’d type the kernel from memory directly in binary.
# They’d enter binary code on panels with toggle switches.
# And they’d inspect memory word by word, watching the diodes.

# Petrovich could feel the levels on the tracks with just his finger.
# He could perceive up to 2 GHz, and if you gave him a pencil in the other hand, he’d even draw the levels on paper tape.
# He could even visualize the oscilloscope diagram with his own eyes in the process.
# And during breaks between the pulses, he’d wink at Lyusya from the neighboring workshop.
# But you need to direct the fan at Petrovich, or his eyelashes burn off from the air friction.

# And Soviet bits could store three values at once!
